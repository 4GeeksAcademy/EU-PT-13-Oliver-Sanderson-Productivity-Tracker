#Productivity Tracker

The productivity tracker will be used during internet browsing sessions to track and record time spent using the browser overall as well as on specific websites. The aim of this application is to increase the users awareness to the amount of time spent using the web browser in total and on which websites the user is spending most time. Thus, helping the user make more informed decisions on time spent and to help them concentrate on the most productive websites.
